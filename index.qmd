### About

Welcome to my site! My name is Yingying. I am a second-year [MHS in Epidemiology](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/academics/mhs-dept-of-epidemiology) student at the Johns Hopkins [Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu). My interests revolve around the convergence of cancer biology, data science, epidemiology, and omics data. Proficient in sequencing data analysis, I have experience in developing R packages, implementing version control on GitHub, and proficiently managing data using SQL.

My enthusiasm lies in leveraging data and analytics to address health-related challenges. I am dedicated to data analysis and contributing to open-source software that elevates the advancements in oncology research.
