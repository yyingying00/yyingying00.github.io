# Welcome!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey there! I am Yingying Yu, and I'm a badminton enthusiast! Whether it's smashing shuttlecocks on the court or watching the pros, badminton is my passion. Let me know if you want to join our JHU varsity team and win the mission!

I am a dog person but also fond of kitties! Shoot me your favorite pic of your baby and I will exchange with mine! FYI, I have a 7 years old brown poodle named Hugo :)
